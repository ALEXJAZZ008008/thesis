	abstract = {PURPOSE: In this article, we discuss dynamic whole-body (DWB) positron emission tomography (PET) as an imaging tool with significant clinical potential, in relation to conventional standard uptake value (SUV) imaging.
BACKGROUND: DWB PET involves dynamic data acquisition over an extended axial range, capturing tracer kinetic information that is not available with conventional static acquisition protocols. The method can be performed within reasonable clinical imaging times, and enables generation of multiple types of PET images with complementary information in a single imaging session. Importantly, DWB PET can be used to produce multi-parametric images of (i) Patlak slope (influx rate) and (ii) intercept (referred to sometimes as "distribution volume"), while also providing (iii) a conventional 'SUV-equivalent' image for certain protocols.
RESULTS: We provide an overview of ongoing efforts (primarily focused on FDG PET) and discuss potential clinically relevant applications.
CONCLUSION: Overall, the framework of DWB imaging [applicable to both PET/CT(computed tomography) and PET/MRI (magnetic resonance imaging)] generates quantitative measures that may add significant value to conventional SUV image-derived measures, with limited pitfalls as we also discuss in this work.},

	abstract = {Dynamic PET (dPET) studies have been used until now primarily within research purposes. Although it is generally accepted that the information provided by dPET is superior to that of conventional static PET acquisitions acquired usually 60 min post injection of the radiotracer, the duration of dynamic protocols, the limited axial field of view (FOV) of current generation clinical PET systems covering a relatively small axial extent of the human body for a dynamic measurement, and the complexity of data evaluation have hampered its implementation into clinical routine. However, the development of new-generation PET/CT scanners with an extended FOV as well as of more sophisticated evaluation software packages that offer better segmentation algorithms, automatic retrieval of the arterial input function, and automatic calculation of parametric imaging, in combination with dedicated shorter dynamic protocols, will facilitate the wider use of dPET. This is expected to aid in oncological diagnostics and therapy assessment. The aim of this review is to present some general considerations about dPET analysis in oncology by means of kinetic modeling, based on compartmental and noncompartmental approaches, and parametric imaging. Moreover, the current clinical applications and future perspectives of the modality are outlined.},

	abstract = {Arm motion during whole-body PET/CT acquisition is not uncommon and can give rise to striking cold artifacts on PET images. We investigated the mechanisms that underlie these artifacts and proposed a potential solution. Methods: A phantom experiment based on 5 clinical cases of suspected arm motion was designed. The experiment involved a central 20-cm-diameter 68Ge/68Ga cylinder simulating the neck and 2 peripheral 10-cm-diameter 18F cylinders simulating arms. After motion-free CT and PET on a whole-body PET/CT system, the position of the arms was altered so as to introduce different amounts of misalignment. Twenty sequential PET scans were acquired in this position, alternating between 2-dimensional (2D) and 3-dimensional (3D) acquisition, as the 18F decayed. Decay of 18F in the arms, while the activity in the 68Ge/68Ga cylinder remained approximately constant, allowed the relative impact of scatter and attenuation-correction errors to be determined. Results: Image artifacts were largely confined to the local region of motion in 2D but extended throughout the affected slices in 3D, where they manifested as a striking underestimation of radiotracer concentration that became more significant with increasing misalignment. For 3D, scatter-correction error depended on activity in the arms, but for typical activity concentrations scatter-correction error was more significant than attenuation-correction error. 3D image reconstruction without scatter correction substantially eliminated these artifacts in both phantom and patient images. Conclusion: Reconstruction artifacts due to patient arm motion can be substantial and should be recognized because they can affect both qualitative and quantitative assessment of PET.},

	abstract = {The combination of positron emission tomography ({PET}) with magnetic resonance ({MR}) imaging opens the way to more accurate diagnosis and improved patient management. At present, the data acquired by {PET}-{MR} scanners are essentially processed separately, but the opportunity to improve accuracy of the tomographic reconstruction via synergy of the two imaging techniques is an active area of research. In this paper, we present Release 2.1.0 of the {CCP}-{PETMR} Synergistic Image Reconstruction Framework ({SIRF}) software suite, providing an open-source software platform for efficient implementation and validation of novel reconstruction algorithms. {SIRF} provides user-friendly Python and {MATLAB} interfaces built on top of C++ libraries. {SIRF} uses advanced {PET} and {MR} reconstruction software packages and tools. Currently, for {PET} this is Software for Tomographic Image Reconstruction ({STIR}); for {MR}, Gadgetron and {ISMRMRD}; and for image registration tools, {NiftyReg}. The software aims to be capable of reconstructing images from acquired scanner data, whilst being simple enough to be used for educational purposes. The most recent version of the software can be downloaded from http://www.ccppetmr.ac.uk/downloads and https://github.com/{CCPPETMR}/. Program summary Program Title: Synergistic Image Reconstruction Framework ({SIRF}) Program Files {DOI}: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/s45f5jh55j.1 Licensing provisions: {GPLv}3 and Apache-2.0 Programming languages: C++, C, Python, {MATLAB} Nature of problem: In current practice, data acquired by {PET}-{MR} scanners are processed separately. Methods for improving the accuracy of the tomographic reconstruction using the synergy of the two imaging techniques are actively being investigated by the {PET}-{MR} research and development community, however, practical application is heavily reliant on software. Open-source software available to the {PET}-{MR} community – such as the {PET} package ({STIR}) (Thielemans et al., 2012) and the {MR} package Gadgetron (Hansen and Sørensen, 2013) – provide a basis for new synergistic {PET}-{MR} software. However, these two software packages are independent and have very different software architectures. They are mostly written in C++ but many researchers in the {PET}-{MR} community are more familiar with script-style languages, such as Python and {MATLAB}, which enable rapid prototyping of novel reconstruction algorithms. In the current situation it is difficult for researchers to exploit any synergy between {PET} and {MR} data. Furthermore, techniques from one field cannot easily be applied in the other. Solution method: In {SIRF}, the bulk of computation is performed by available advanced open-source reconstruction and registration software (currently {STIR}, Gadgetron and {NiftyReg}) that can use multithreading and {GPUs}. The {SIRF} C++ code provides a thin layer on top of these existing libraries. The {SIRF} layer has unified data-containers and access mechanisms. This C++ layer provides the basis for a simple and intuitive Python and {MATLAB} interface, enabling users to quickly develop and test their reconstruction algorithms using these scripting languages only. At the same time, advanced users proficient in C++ can directly utilise wider {SIRF} functionality via the {SIRF} C++ libraries that we provide.},

	doi = {10.1097/00000542-200405000-00006},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The authors have recently shown with positron emission tomography that subanesthetic doses of racemic ketamine increase cerebral blood flow but do not affect oxygen consumption significantly. In this study, the authors wanted to assess the effects of racemic ketamine on regional glucose metabolic rate (rGMR) in similar conditions to establish whether ketamine truly induces disturbed coupling between cerebral blood flow and metabolism.
METHODS: 18F-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose was used as a positron emission tomography tracer to quantify rGMR on 12 brain regions of interest of nine healthy male volunteers at baseline and during a 300-ng/ml ketamine target concentration level. In addition, voxel-based analysis was performed for the relative changes in rGMR using statistical parametric mapping.
RESULTS: The mean +/- SD measured ketamine serum concentration was 326.4+/-86.3 ng/ml. The mean arterial pressure was slightly increased (maximally by 16.4\%) during ketamine infusion (P {\textless} 0.001). Ketamine increased absolute rGMR significantly in most regions of interest studied. The greatest increases were detected in the thalamus (14.6+/-15.9\%; P = 0.029) and in the frontal (13.6+/-13.1\%; P = 0.011) and parietal cortices (13.1+/-11.2\%; P = 0.007). Absolute rGMR was not decreased anywhere in the brain. The voxel-based analysis revealed relative rGMR increases in the frontal, temporal, and parietal cortices.
CONCLUSIONS: Global increases in rGMR seem to parallel ketamine-induced increases in cerebral blood flow detected in the authors' earlier study. Therefore, ketamine-induced disturbance of coupling between cerebral blood flow and metabolism is highly unlikely. The previously observed decrease in oxygen extraction fraction may be due to nonoxidative glucose metabolism during ketamine-induced increase in glutamate release.},

The present study is a comprehensive analysis of the clinical correlation between tumor size at diagnosis and pathological grades, clinical staging, disparities of treatment, and survival of patients with HCC.Materials and methods: Patients with HCC were separated into groups according to tumor size as follows: 0.1\&ndash;2.0, 2.1\&ndash;5.0, 5.1\&ndash;10.0, and 10.1\&ndash;20.0\&nbsp;cm. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the relationship between tumor size at diagnosis and pathological grade, Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) historic stage A, and treatment selection. The survival of HCC patients stratified by tumor size was estimated by Kaplan\&ndash;Meier and 5-year survival analyses using the log-rank test. Multivariable analysis of overall survival was performed using the Cox proportional hazards model. Tumor size at diagnosis was an independent risk factor of pathological grade, and SEER historic stage A was revealed by logistic regression analysis.Results: The 5-year survival rate was 21.9\% vs 14.3\% vs 9.2\% vs 7.7\% for all HCC patients and 31.2\% vs 23.6\% vs 20.3\% vs 15.5\% for patients who underwent surgery with tumor sizes of 0.1\&ndash;2.0 vs 2.1\&ndash;5.0 and 5.1\&ndash;10.0 vs 10.1\&ndash;20.0 cm, respectively; multivariable Cox regression analysis identified tumor size at diagnosis as an independent predictor of survival risk with HR of 1.00 vs 1.66 vs 2.92 vs 3.67, respectively.Conclusion: Tumor size at diagnosis could be used as an independent risk predictor associated with histological grade, stage, selection of surgery, and survival in HCC.

	doi = {10.1118/1.3480985},
	abstract = {PURPOSE: The authors develop the 4D extended cardiac-torso (XCAT) phantom for multimodality imaging research.
METHODS: Highly detailed whole-body anatomies for the adult male and female were defined in the XCAT using nonuniform rational B-spline (NURBS) and subdivision surfaces based on segmentation of the Visible Male and Female anatomical datasets from the National Library of Medicine as well as patient datasets. Using the flexibility of these surfaces, the Visible Human anatomies were transformed to match body measurements and organ volumes for a 50th percentile (height and weight) male and female. The desired body measurements for the models were obtained using the PEOPLESIZE program that contains anthropometric dimensions categorized from 1st to the 99th percentile for US adults. The desired organ volumes were determined from ICRP Publication 89 [ICRP, "Basic anatomical and physiological data for use in radiological protection: reference values," ICRP Publication 89 (International Commission on Radiological Protection, New York, NY, 2002)]. The male and female anatomies serve as standard templates upon which anatomical variations may be modeled in the XCAT through user-defined parameters. Parametrized models for the cardiac and respiratory motions were also incorporated into the XCAT based on high-resolution cardiac- and respiratory-gated multislice CT data. To demonstrate the usefulness of the phantom, the authors show example simulation studies in PET, SPECT, and CT using publicly available simulation packages.
RESULTS: As demonstrated in the pilot studies, the 4D XCAT (which includes thousands of anatomical structures) can produce realistic imaging data when combined with accurate models of the imaging process. With the flexibility of the NURBS surface primitives, any number of different anatomies, cardiac or respiratory motions or patterns, and spatial resolutions can be simulated to perform imaging research.
CONCLUSIONS: With the ability to produce realistic, predictive 3D and 4D imaging data from populations of normal and abnormal patients under various imaging parameters, the authors conclude that the XCAT provides an important tool in imaging research to evaluate and improve imaging devices and techniques. In the field of x-ray CT, the phantom may also provide the necessary foundation with which to optimize clinical CT applications in terms of image quality versus radiation dose, an area of research that is becoming more significant with the growing use of CT.},
