\begin{abstract}
    \gls{RM} is a significant problem when it comes to the quality of \gls{PET} images. \gls{RM} not only causes blurring of lesions, and other features within the lung, but can also cause problems when it comes to applying \gls{AC} to the acquired \gls{PET} data. \gls{RM} can be mitigated by gating but this leads to longer acquisition time. Problems related to \gls{AC} include the fact that the attenuation map is acquired temporally apart from the \gls{PET} scan, and different instructions are given to the patient for each scan (free breathing vs breath hold). Thus, the \gls{Mu-Map} may not correspond to any position in the \gls{PET} data and certainly won't correspond to all of them. Meaning that if a static \gls{Mu-Map} is used to apply \gls{AC} not only will the \gls{RM} exist to corrupt the data but so will the mismatch of the \gls{Mu-Map}.

    \gls{MC} methods exist which incorporate \gls{IR} in order to attempt to improve upon \gls{Non-MC} results. Often these methods involve separating the \gls{PET} data into bins, where the \gls{RM} is minimised within each bin. However, because of the high level of noise and low spatial resolution of \gls{PET} data, few bins are often used, leading to a not insignificant amount of \gls{RM} still being present in the resultant images. Additionally, this approach does not solve the mismatch of the \gls{Mu-Map}. Logically, the bin closest to the \gls{Mu-Map} could be used as the reference bin for \gls{IR} but it is not guaranteed that this bin will be close to the position of the \gls{Mu-Map} and as such artefacts will remain in the final image. Furthermore, \gls{IR} fails when used on dynamic \gls{PET} data, where the signal from the aorta, at early time points, often leads to misregistration. More complex \gls{MC} methods exist, however, these methods, in general, tend to be more resource intensive in both the sense of computation time and computational resources.

    This thesis focuses on the development of a \gls{MC} method, which seeks to rectify some of the issues above by using respiratory gated data in combination with \glss{MM}. Firstly, this thesis will present more preliminary results, where the bounds of the problem were found. This includes experiments to discover the effectiveness of different \gls{MC} techniques (focusing on \glss{MM}) in the case of \gls{TOF} vs \gls{Non-TOF} \gls{PET} data, especially where a high number of bins are used. This thesis will also present work related to attempting to solve the mismatch of the \gls{Mu-Map} by deforming it to the position during the gates. Furthermore, work will also be presented which compares the effects of the reconstruction and \gls{MM} fitting process, including using \gls{MLACF}, to approximate \gls{AC}, as well as fitting a \gls{MM} on coarsely binned data and applying it to finely binned data.
    
    Finally, this thesis will also present work on the problems of \gls{DD} \gls{SS} extraction methods applied to dynamic \gls{PET}. A \gls{SS} is imperative to the effectiveness of binning data as well as to \gls{MM} fitting. By presenting work relevant to \gls{SS} extraction from dynamic \gls{PET} this work potentially opens the \gls{MC} methods presented previously to the application of dynamic \gls{PET}.

    This thesis will conclude with a critique of the work presented previously as well as a look to the future of how this work could be improved or further used.
